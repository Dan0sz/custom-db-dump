# WP-CLI Strip Database Dump

This is a tiny plugin, which adds shorthands to WP-CLI which allows you to easily create database dumps and exclude
sensitive data.

The following options are available:

- `--users`: excludes the `wp_users` and `wp_usermeta` tables.
- `--customers`: excludes Customer related tables for supported 3rd party plugins.
- `--orders`: excludes Order related tables for supported 3rd party plugins.
- `--all`: exclude all of the above.

After running the command, 2 separate database exports are created:

1. `[your-filename]-1.sql` containing all tables where data should be retained.
2. `[your-filename]-2.sql` containing all tables where all data should be stripped.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The created DB dumps must be imported in the provided order.

### Usage

To create a database that excludes orders, customers and users and save it one directory up from the current directory,
run it as
follows:

````
wp strip-db dump ../stripped-db-dump.sql --all
````

To just strip customer data and store the dump in the current directory, run:

````
wp strip-db dump stripped-dump --customers
````

> [!NOTE]
> It's not required to append a file extension to the filename argument.

If no filename is provided, a random one will be generated and saved in WordPress' root directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the `--users` parameter is added to the command, the `users` table will be empty when importing it to your
> database. This means you need to create at least a new administrator user after importing the generated table. This
> can
> be done using the following
> WP-CLI command: `wp user create username email@address.com --role=administrator`.
